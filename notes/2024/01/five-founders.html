            <br>
            <p>In the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of innovation, certain individuals stand out not just for their accomplishments, but for the visions they embody and the paths they pave for themselves and others. This essay explores the journeys and philosophies of five (ten in reality) sets of founders who have not only created influential startups or organizations but have also inspired me professionally and personally.</p>
            <h3>1. Ivan Zhao, Simon Last, Akshay Kothari (Notion)</h3>       
            <p>These three founders represent a triumvirate of vision, technical prowess, and operational acumen. Their creation, Notion, is not merely a tool but a canvas, reflecting their belief in the democratization of organization and productivity. Ivan imbues the company with a vision influenced by HCI greats like Doug Engelbart and Alan Kay. He's set Notion on a path to transcend traditional software boundaries and mirror the fluidity and interconnectedness of human thought. Additionally, his sense of design and style is such a killer aesthetic. All of the projects that I work on are influenced by him in some way. His taste is just that good. Simon Last's technical leadership is very underrated (just like his music). He's incredibly talented and the engineering at Notion is extremely robust because of him. Lastly, Akshay Kothari's operational expertise guarantees that the company becomes the next Microsoft. He's also a great people person.</p>
            <h3>2. Steve Jobs (Apple)</h3>
            <p>This man needs no introduction. His approach to technology was an art: a pursuit of perfection, an unyielding belief in the power of design, and a relentless drive to create products that were not just functional but also beautiful and intuitive. Similar to Ivan Zhao, his vision of technology was deeply human-centered, focusing on how it could enhance, rather than complicate, human life. His legacy is not just a range of products but a philosophy of design and innovation that continues to influence. He also helped make Pixar into what it is today. That's really awesome.</p>
            <h3>3. Julian Park, Denys Bastov, Cecilia Uhr (Bezi)</h3>
            <p>Bezi is a startup that is less known but equally as fascinating as Notion or Apple in my eyes. Julian, Denys, and Cecilia have carved out a niche that balances aesthetic, technological innovation, and user experience. </p><br>
            <p>I had the pleasure of meeting Julian Park in person at this year's MIT Reality Hack (that was actually the exigence of this post). It was so awesome to hear how thinks about spatial computing, startups, and 3D.</p>
            <h3>4. Fernando Oshima (VIVY/Grao)</h3>
            <p>Although I never knew Fernando, as a startup founder, I did know him as a VC and as my boss when I worked at Grao VC over the summer in Sao Paulo. He has an incredible ability to mix his friendly personality with business wisdom and soft assertiveness. I learned a lot about startups, venture capital, and leadership when I was workng for him.</p>
            <h3>5. Alice Cai (Augmentation Lab @ Harvard)</h3>
            <p>Alice is crazy but in an awesome way. She originally reached out to me last year asking if I wanted to work on a startup with her. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good time for me to do that, but the demo she showed me at the Augmentation Lab. The way that she has built up the Augmentation Lab, the Residency program, and the VR/AR club at Harvard is so inspirational. I wish her nothing but the best in her goal of becoming a cyborg in the future.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><i>HONORABLE MENTIONS</i></h3>
            <p>Here are some other founders that I didn't put in the main list, but I still wanted to include them and give them an honorable mention.</p>
            <h3>6. Alex Fan (MITIT)</h3>
            <p>It's amazing to watch someone turn an idea into a tournament that raised tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of competitors, and even an appearance from the top competitive programmer in the world. Alex once told me that he hopes to overtake ICPC as the premier competitive programming tournament worldwide. I believe he's going to achieve that one day, I hope to be a part of that mission.</p>
            <h3>7. Aryo Patel (Stealth Startup)</h3>
            <p>This man is the nicest, smartest, most determined hacker I know. Even though he went to the rival high school (he goes to MIT which is why I mainly know him), I still really enjoy his company and his intellect. He's working on something super secret now, but I hope it all pans out for him.</p>
            <h3>8. Noah Pravacek (NodeKit)</h3>
            <p>This dude is insane. I went to high school with him. He is a ruthless operator and is the most persistent problem-solver I know. He now runs a crypto startup called NodeKit. They recently raised over $1M, and I'm excited to see where </p>
            <h3>9. Edwin Catmull (Pixar)</h3>
            <p>I was deciding between Steve Jobs and Ed for the main list, but I just had to give it to Steve. However, that doesn't mean Ed has lesser accomplishments. Not only was he a pioneer in computer graphics, but he also made one of my favorite companies of all time. From their first movie all the way to like 2010, Pixar was unstoppable. No amount of creativity and magic has been exported at such high quality and at such a high level since. He is a GOAT.</p>
            <h3>10. Jesus Lares (Aura Intelligence)</h3>
            <p>This man is smart and awesome. His startup is ambitious and exciting. He is the person most responsible for me learning and getting into AI development.</p>

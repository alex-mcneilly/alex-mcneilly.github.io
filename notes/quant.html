      <h2 style="font-family: var(--header-font);margin-bottom: 0;">Flirting with Quant</h2>
      <hr style="border: 1px solid #dadada;" />
      <p>The fluorescent lights of the Sloan study room flickered.</p>

      <p>They buzzed, casting an eerie glow over the sea of notebooks and energy drinks strewn across the desk. It was
        liminal 3AM July night (morning?), and I found myself staring blankly at yet another probability problem. It was
        taunting me. It mocked my efforts. This scene had become too familiar over the months prior. Why? Because I
        wanted to be a quant.</p>

      <p>Quant was an obsession for me. My older friends, and the people I followed online, already worked or secured
        coveted positions at these quant firms. I wanted in, too. I heard about all of the perks: the free food,
        unlimited Diet Dr. Pepper, gym, housing, baseball games, and merch. I drooled over the salaries and that sweet,
        sweet sign-on bonus. Seeing the success of my older friends and liking the thought of playing poker all day for
        a summer (oversimplification) motivated me to get a quant job.</p>

      <p>But it wasn't just about that juicy sign-on bonus and the prestige of saying I worked in finance. Deep down, a
        part of me hoped that landing a quant job would finally silence the nagging voice of inadequacy that had taken
        residence in my head last year. The friend group that I was in last year was toxic. All of them were very
        intelligent and overachieving. The problem was that they were snobby about it. It didn't support a lot of
        confidence in myself and made me feel like an impostor. A fraud even. Quant, in that context, became a lifeline.
        A chance to prove my worth.</p>

      <p>So I dove in, head first and eyes wide open. Nights blurred into days as I scoured every resource I could
        find—Glassdoor, Reddit, 3point1acres, WallStreetOasis, Blind—hunting for the secret formula to get into quant.
        After months of hard work, some successes, and some failures, here's what I found about preparing for and
        getting into quant:</p>

      <p>First off, I don't know if I am qualified or not to give advice. My background is atypical. I have zero
        competitive math background, have never done the Putnam, and all of my prior experience is in software
        engineering. These are just my thoughts and how I prepared. Please take everything with a grain of salt and take
        this guide more as a list of suggestions and possible resources to use to prepare for quant. I also will talk
        about why I personally thought quant wasn't right for me after doing all of this.</p>

      <p>To begin, a lot of online resources and prep books are stupid, bloated, or irrelevant. There are only a handful
        of resources that actually helped me. Also, preparing for quant and SWE will get you nowhere. This was probably
        my biggest mistake. I thought I could do both. I couldn't, and you probably can't either. The mental models you
        have when preparing for interviews in quant vs. interviews in SWE, are very different, and it's best to refine
        one at the expense of the other.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Poker</h3>

      <p>Learn poker and play <b>lots of it</b>. Lots of quant questions, at their core, are similar to poker. Many
        quant questions ask if or how much money you should put into a game given some information. A lot of times this
        game is a card game like poker. The pace of quant interviews is too fast for you to really sit down and think
        about <i>exact</i> pot odds or probabilities.<br><br>You have to build up your intuition and reaction time to
        respond and get "hunches" or "gut feelings" that you think are correct. This can most effectively be built up by
        playing lots of poker and practicing poker theory while playing quick games against an opponent. Some resources
        and terms that helped me build my poker intuition were:</p>

      <ul style="color: var(--text-body);">
        <li>calculating <b>pot odds</b>, <b>equity</b>, <b>implied odds</b>, <b>pot share</b>, <b>expected value</b>,
          and <b>hand ranges</b></li>
        <li><b>Kelly-criterion</b> for managing risk</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Puzzles</h3>

      <p>In addition to building poker intuition, building puzzle intuition helped a lot. Brainteasers aren't really
        asked a lot anymore in quant questions, although they do pop up sometimes (based on other friends' accounts).
        You can kind of think of solving puzzles as a more passive study method.<br><br>When you are bored of actually
        practicing quant questions, just do some of these puzzles or watch some of these videos to still build up your
        intuition. Although you won't usually be asked these kinds of brainteasers, thinking about the solutions, even
        if they are unexpected or counterintuitive, can allow you to apply those techniques on interview problems. Some
        resources and videos that helped me build my puzzle intuition were:</p>

      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>Studying for quant is <b>NOT</b> like studying for SWE. It involves more intuition and much more practice than
        memorizing algorithms and mapping LeetCode solutions onto a given question. There are four main areas that get
        tested in quant: <b>arithmetic</b>, <b>probability</b>, <b>applied trading questions</b>, and <b>market
          knowledge</b>. If you build up your
        intuition and skills in these areas in this order, then you should be well-prepared to do quant interviews</p>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Arithmetic</h3>

      <p>For arithmetic, you need to know how to do harder mental arithmetic at high speeds. This could be for a
        specific arithmetic test they have you do, or for making calculations or approximations for certain values in an
        interview. You should not move on to probability until you are comfortable with fast mental arithmetic. Some
        resources that helped me with my mental arithmetic are:</p>

      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Probability</h3>

      <p>For probability, you need to know probability theory first. If you have taken a discrete math class before, you
        probably already know enough, but reviewing some of it with either the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/">MIT Discrete Math OCW
          course</a> or a
        textbook is a good idea. You should focus on card problems and dice problems. My friends and I encountered tons
        of dice problems, and the card problems aren't hard if you already built up your poker intuition. Here are some
        resources that you should go through to build up your probability intuition:</p>

      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Trading Questions</h3>

      <p>For the applied trading questions, you should practice them until you can instantly think of an approach or
        trick to solve the problem. This is like the most "LeetCode" portion of interview prep, so memorizing and
        understanding solutions should be sufficient. Here are some resources that helped me prep:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662">The Green
            Book</a> (mainly chapters 1, 2, and 4)</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Market Knowledge</h3>

      <p>For market knowledge, I didn't have a lot of trouble because I was already familiar with economics and finance.
        However, if you have no experience in these areas, definitely learn some trading-centric terms and concepts. You
        don't have to understand the deep intricacies of the market, but you should know when to apply
        finance-influenced common sense to a trading scenario. <a
          href="https://akunacapital.teachable.com/p/options101">Akuna Capital</a> has a good course that covers enough
        high
        level understanding of the market and exchanges. You can also look on <a
          href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-trading.asp">Investopedia</a> for what specific terms
        like
        "market maker" mean.</p>

      <p>For preparing for interviews, I made friends who had interviewed or worked at those places to give me mock
        interviews. When they weren't available, I did a back and forth with ChatGPT. I also looked at Glassdoor and
        Blind for what trading interviews at those firms looked like. I mainly applied to the firms that were sponsors
        of MITIT along with a few smaller firms and even some firms that I later found out were crypto-centric. Here is
        how I would rank the quant firms based on my experience:</p>

      <p><strong>Sponsors MITIT + They Love Me:</strong> Hudson River Trading, Jane Street, Jump Trading</p>

      <p><strong>Sponsors MITIT + They Don't Dislike Me:</strong> Five Rings, Citadel, Tower Research Capital</p>

      <p><strong>Doesn't Sponsor MITIT + OK:</strong> Akuna, Arrowstreet, Capula, Chicago Trading Company, DE Shaw, DRW,
        Flow Traders, IMC, Optiver, Old Mission Capital, Radix, SIG, Two Sigma</p>

      <p><strong>Doesn't Sponsor MITIT + Huh:</strong> Acadian, AQR, Balyasny, Belvedere, Bridgewater,
        Cubist, DV Trading, Garda, PDT Partners, Peak6, Schonfeld, Wolverine Trading</p>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">A Realization</h3>

      <p>However, after months of intense practice and lots of awkward or triumphant interviews, I started to feel my
        frosted quant dream cookies crumble. The more I interviewed and learned more about the kind of
        work you do as a quant, the more I realized I actually didn't like it. The more I practiced probability and
        thought about poker, the more I yearned for the creative, hands-on problem solving of SWE. Quant trading and
        research, both of which I had convinced myself I would grow to love, never actually stuck with me.</p>

      <p>As I reflected on my past experiences—the UROPs that had always gravitated towards software engineering, even
        when disguised as research—a weight began to lift from my shoulders. I realized that in my desperate quest for
        validation, I had nearly abandoned the field that truly ignited my passion. The irony wasn't lost on me. In
        trying to prove my worth, I had almost lost sight of what made me truly valuable in the first place. I was
        treating SWE like a fallback option; it was where my strengths and interests truly aligned. I abandoned a good
        friend just to try and hang out with the popular kids. I was Cady from Mean Girls.</p>

      <p>So here I stand, at the end of a journey I never expected to take. The quant preparation materials I amassed -
        the probability guides, the market intuition resources, the arithmetic drills - they're still valuable tools
        that have sharpened my technical skills. But they're not a blueprint for my future.<br><br>To the younger
        students who
        might be interested in quant, I offer this; There's immense value in pushing your boundaries and exploring new
        fields. Any new skill you gain and the self-knowledge you acquire is never wasted. However, don't let the allure
        of prestige or the fear of inadequacy drown out your true passions.</p>

      <p>I was not passionate about quant. As much as I wanted to be a trader, I realized I wouldn't enjoy the actual
        work involved. You
        shouldn't do something you wouldn't actually enjoy, right? If you don't know if you want to do quant and you
        don't
        have the probability intuition or arithmetic speed already, then I suggest you do something you are truly
        passionate about. If you love probability and numbers and poker and would love to do research and statistics,
        then definitely do quant.</p>

      <p>I have a new appreciation for SWE, and a near-addiction to coding now. Trading or research at a quant firm
        might not be my destination, but building the software those traders use at that firm might be.
        Ultimately, trying and half-succeeding at getting into quant made me more secure in being a SWE. My path forward
        is clearer, not because it's easier, but because it's mine.</p>

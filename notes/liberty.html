        <p>My favorite American invention is the airplane.</p>        <br>
        <p>
          Growing up on the outskirts of Chicago, the constant rumbles of jet
          engines overhead became the soundtrack of my childhood. Every three
          minutes—like clockwork—these metal birds would soar above my home,
          entering or exiting Chicago’s busiest airport. To me, the airplane
          isn't just a marvel of engineering; it's an embodiment of the American
          spirit and a symbol of my own American journey.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Like the planes I would look up to cutting through the sky, my story
          begins with a leap of faith. I am the product of immigrants: a poor
          orphan boy from Mexico and a woman with Irish and Polish roots whose
          family escaped European tyranny. My father's dangerous journey from
          Mexico 25 years ago and my mother's ancestors fleeing pre-World War II
          Europe are testaments to the magnetic pull of America's promise.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Though my parents never married and I lived with my mother growing up,
          both sides of my heritage have shaped me profoundly. Although he
          wasn’t around much, I still feel deeply connected to the Gulf Coast
          indigenous culture my father is from. I remember visiting his
          apartment and smelling the aroma of tamales steaming in banana
          leaves—a technique he insisted holds more flavor than corn husks. I
          remember hearing about his dangerous journey across the Mexican desert
          to America, and his subsequent hard work in being a part-time butcher
          to fund his sister’s journey to this country and trying to build his
          own food company. He embodies the American Dream. He took a great risk
          coming to a new land with a new language, and I admire him greatly for
          that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          On the other side, my mother’s family was more traditionally
          “American,” although very old-school Polish and Irish. Growing up
          poor—or "lower middle class" as I was taught to say—in an affluent
          Chicago suburb wasn't easy. The Great Recession hit my mother hard.
          After losing her job, she decided to start an online business back
          when such ventures were far from common like today. Working alongside
          her from a young age and helping her with all the “confusing computer
          thingies” taught me perseverance, grit, and reinvention. I also
          appreciate her ability to take a huge risk doing this as an unemployed
          single mother. However, the ability to do this at all reinforces the
          greatness of this country. I am also eternally grateful to her for
          making my childhood fun and worthwhile despite our material
          conditions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My grandparents on my mother’s side introduced me to the breathtaking
          beauty of America’s national parks. Our road trips, camping under vast
          starry skies, made me fall in love with this land’s natural wonders. I
          remember making mac and cheese and cooking Vienna Beef hot dogs over a
          campfire in Yosemite and Yellowstone and Zion and Sequoia and the
          Badlands. I felt like a pioneer who first encountered these lands in
          the 1800s.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As I grew older and entered high school, I sequestered myself in
          intense focus. I pushed myself to overcome all challenges I
          encountered. However, one of the strangest challenges I faced was
          racism. Racism is the harsh reality that America’s promise of equality
          is still a work in progress. However, it’s very confusing to me. Like,
          why do you care that I’m different from you? When I’m eating my lunch
          and you come up to me and say: “Hey beaner, what are you eating for
          lunch? Some rice and beans?” and I say “yes,” and you pause, what were
          you expecting me to say? Racism is irrational lmao.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          But it wasn't all work while I was in high school—wandering south side
          Chicago's winter streets with my cousin, making rap beats, and DJ-ing
          house parties, I dreamed big American dreams. Even when the pandemic
          and a battle with hyperacusis derailed my music aspirations (I wanted
          to put off going to MIT to become a rapper/producer), I found new
          paths forward. This ability to adapt and reinvent oneself is, I
          believe, a cornerstone of the American experience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Now, as I pursue math and computers at MIT, I reflect on the stark
          contrast between my background and my current situation. How does the
          poor son of a Mexican orphan and a self-employed single mother end up
          at one of the top schools in the world? The answer lies in the unique
          mix of opportunity, hard work, and the American dream—the same
          elements that lifted the Wright brothers' invention off the ground at
          Kitty Hawk.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          America, like any nation, has its flaws—a history marked by injustice
          and ongoing struggles with inequality. Yet it's also a land of
          unparalleled wealth and opportunity, where the pursuit of science and
          technology embodies our pioneer spirit. From the Wright brothers to
          Silicon Valley, we've been at the forefront of innovation, constantly
          pushing boundaries and redefining what's possible. What makes America
          truly great are its people and ideals. Our unwavering belief in
          freedom, our capacity for self-reflection and improvement, and our
          endless pursuit of a "more perfect union" set us apart. Our natural
          wonders inspire awe and the pioneer spirit. Our entrepreneurs, whether
          startup founders, tamale salesmen, or life coaches, drive progress not
          just for our nation, but for the world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As I look to the future, ready to serve this country in industry and
          technology, I carry with me the lessons learned from those planes
          soaring over my childhood home. They taught me to aim high, to weather
          turbulence with grace, and to take leaps of faith. To me, America is
          more than just a country—it's an idea, a dream that takes flight with
          each generation. It's a place where the child of immigrants can look
          up at passing planes and dare to dream of soaring among them. Despite
          its imperfections, America remains a beacon of hope—a place where
          dreams can and do

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In the face of challenges, both personal and national, I'm reminded of
          the resilience that defines our pioneer spirit. We are a nation
          continually striving to live up to our highest ideals, to create a
          society that truly offers liberty and justice for all. It's this
          ongoing journey, this commitment to growth and betterment, that fills
          me with profound gratitude and pride. My country tis of thee.
